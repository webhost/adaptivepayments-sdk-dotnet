      * PreapprovalDetails: Obtains information about a preapproval.
      * CancelPreapproval: Cancels a preapproval.
   * Other Operations
      * Refund: Refunds all or part of a payment
      * ConvertCurrency: Obtains the current foreign exchange (FX) rate for a specific amount and currency.

## Prerequisites

   * Visual Studio 2005 or higher
   * .NET Framework 2.0 or higher
   * (Optional) NuGet 2.2 for managing dependencies

## Using the SDK

   To use the SDK in your application, you must
   
   * Get the PayPalAdaptivePaymentsSDK dll via NuGet or from the download bundle and add references to the PayPalAdaptivePaymentsSDK and PayPalCoreSDK libraries.
   * Configure your app as detailed in the configuration section.
   
## SDK Configuration

  An application that uses the PayPal SDKs can be configured in one of two ways -
  
  * Using the Web.Config / App.Config files.

	```html
    <configSections>
	<section name="paypal" type="PayPal.Manager.SDKConfigHandler, PayPalCoreSDK" />
	<section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net" />
	</configSections>
	<!-- PayPal SDK config -->
	<paypal>
	<settings>
	    <add name="mode" value="sandbox"/>	    
	    <add name="connectionTimeout" value="30000"/>
	    .....
	</settings>
	<accounts>
	    <account apiUsername="jb-us-seller_api1.paypal.com" apiPassword="..." apiSignature="..."/>
	    <account apiUsername="enduser_biz_api1.gmail.com" apiPassword="..." apiCertificate="..." privateKeyPassword="..."/>
	</accounts>
	</paypal>
    ```
  
  * Or, by dynamically passing in a dictionary (that you can load from a database or as suits your needs).

    ```csharp
    Dictionary<string, string> config = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    config.Add("mode", "sandbox");
    config.Add("account1.apiUsername", "jb-us-seller_api1.paypal.com");
    config.Add("account1.apiPassword", "...");
    config.Add("account1.apiSignature", "...");

    AdaptivePaymentsService service = new  AdaptivePaymentsService(config);
    ```
