The PayPal Adaptive Payments API enables merchants and developers to pay almost anyone and set up automated payments. The PayPal Adaptive Payments SDK provides the following methods:

   * Payments
      * Pay: Transfers funds from a sender's PayPal account to one or more receivers' PayPal accounts (up to 6 receivers).
      * PaymentDetails: Obtains information about a payment created with the Pay API operation.
      * ExecutePayment: Executes a payment.
      * GetPaymentOptions: Obtain the settings specified with the SetPaymentOptions API operation.
      * SetPaymentOptions: Sets payment options.
   * Preapprovals
      * Preapproval: Sets up preapprovals, which is an approval to make future payments on the sender's behalf.
      * PreapprovalDetails: Obtains information about a preapproval.
      * CancelPreapproval: Cancels a preapproval.
   * Other Operations
      * Refund: Refunds all or part of a payment
      * ConvertCurrency: Obtains the current foreign exchange (FX) rate for a specific amount and currency.
      * GetFundingPlans: Determines the funding sources that are available for a specified payment.
      * GetShippingAddresses: Obtains the selected shipping address.

## Prerequisites

   * Visual Studio 2005 or higher
   * .NET Framework 2.0 or higher
   * (Optional) NuGet 2.2 for managing dependencies

## Using the SDK

   To use the SDK in your application, you must
   
   * Get the PayPalAdaptivePaymentsSDK dll via NuGet or from the download bundle and add references to the PayPalAdaptivePaymentsSDK and PayPalCoreSDK libraries.
   * Configure your app as detailed in the configuration section.
   
## SDK Configuration

  An application that uses the PayPal SDKs can be configured in one of two ways -
  
  * Using the Web.Config / App.Config files.

	```html
    <configSections>
	<section name="paypal" type="PayPal.Manager.SDKConfigHandler, PayPalCoreSDK" />
	<section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net" />
	</configSections>
	<!-- PayPal SDK config -->
	<paypal>
	<settings>
	    <add name="mode" value="sandbox"/>	    
	    <add name="connectionTimeout" value="30000"/>
	    .....
	</settings>
	<accounts>
	    <account apiUsername="jb-us-seller_api1.paypal.com" apiPassword="..." apiSignature="..." applicationId='...' />
	    <account apiUsername="enduser_biz_api1.gmail.com" apiPassword="..." apiCertificate="..." privateKeyPassword="..." applicationId='...' />
	</accounts>
	</paypal>
    ```
  
  * Or, by dynamically passing in a dictionary (that you can load from a database or as suits your needs).

    ```csharp
    Dictionary<string, string> config = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    config.Add("mode", "sandbox");
    config.Add("account1.apiUsername", "jb-us-seller_api1.paypal.com");
    config.Add("account1.apiPassword", "...");
    config.Add("account1.apiSignature", "...");
    config.Add("account1.applicationId", "...");    

    AdaptivePaymentsService service = new  AdaptivePaymentsService(config);
    ```

	You can refer full list of configuration parameters in [wiki](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-core-dotnet/wiki/SDK-Configuration-Parameters)


## Example

```csharp
using PayPal.AdaptivePayments;
using PayPal.AdaptivePayments.Model;

// Assuming you will configure using the Web.Config / App.Config files.
var service = new AdaptivePaymentsService();

var receiverList = new ReceiverList(new List<Receiver>
{
    new Receiver { email = "receiver1@gmail.com", amount = 10m,
    new Receiver { email = "receiver2@gmail.com", amount = 20m}
});

var payRequest = new PayRequest(
    new RequestEnvelope { errorLanguage = "en_US", detailLevel = DetailLevelCode.RETURNALL},
    "PAY", "http://localhost:60686/Paypal/Cancel",
    "USD", receiverList, "http://localhost:60686/Paypal/Return");

var response = service.Pay(payRequest);
```
